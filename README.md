# Learning Rust ðŸ¦€

Hello friend! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my "Learning Rust" repo, a home for my notes as I'm learning [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). I'm structuring everything into lessons, which can be found in `src/lessons`. I'm explaining the concepts with comments, followed by an example code block. All of the lessons are runabale, so you can clone this repo and play around with the examples. Make sure you pull from this repo from time to time to get the new lessons as I'm publishing them.

My main learning resource is [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book).

So poke around the repo and have fun! If you see a typo, or have a better example in mind, feel free to open a PR.

> P.S. This could turn into a workshop! Hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NikolovLazar) if you're interested!

## System Requirements

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed to run the examples. Follow the [official installation guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).
