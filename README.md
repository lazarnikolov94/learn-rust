# Learning Rust 🦀

Hello friend! 👋

Welcome to my "Learning Rust" repo, a home for my notes as I'm learning [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). My main learning resource is [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book).

Poke around the repo. If you see a typo, or have a better example in mind, feel free to open a PR 🙏!

> P.S. This could turn into a workshop! Hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NikolovLazar) if you're interested!
