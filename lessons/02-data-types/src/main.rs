 * Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.

     * - characters

    // ========= INTEGERS =========
    /*
     * An integer is a number without a fractional component. They come in six variants:
     * - 8-bit (can hold 2‚Å∏ -> 256)
     * - 16-bit (can hold 2¬π‚Å∂ -> 65.536)
     * - 32-bit (can hold 2¬≥¬≤ -> 4.294.967.296)
     * - 64-bit (can hold 2‚Å∂‚Å¥ -> 18.446.744.073.709.551.616 üòÖ)
     * - 128-bit (can hold 2¬π¬≤‚Å∏ -> 340.282.366.920.938.463.463.374.607.431.768.211.460 üòµ‚Äçüí´)
     * - arch
     *
     * Each variant can be either Signed or Unsigned.
     * Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2‚Åø‚Åª¬π) to 2‚Åø‚Åª¬π-1 inclusive, where "n" is the number of bits the variant uses.
     * For example, the signed 8-bit can store numbers from -(2‚Å∏‚Åª¬π) to 2‚Å∏‚Åª¬π-1, or from -128 to 127.
     * Signed and Unsigned refer to whether it's possible for the number to be negative.
     * Signed integers can be negative (they can have a sign, a "minus").
     * Unsigned integers are always positive (we don't write +6, just 6).

     * A floating-point number is a number with decimal points. We'll call them floats from here on.
     * Rust have two primitive types for floats: 32-bits and 64-bits (f32 and f64).
     * The 32-bit float is also called a single precision float.
     * The 64-bit float is a double-precision float.
